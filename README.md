# Shared Unity Utilities
This is a personal collection of packages I use in my own projects. Many things are heavily inspired by `Git-Amend`'s videos on youtube.

### Project Setup
`https://github.com/LucasOCastro/Shared-Unity-Utilities.git/?path=Packages/Automated Setup/`
Automatically creates my usual folder structure and imports my packages and assets of choice.

### Shared Utilities
`https://github.com/LucasOCastro/Shared-Unity-Utilities.git/?path=Packages/SharedUtilities/`
Extension methods I use often, and a preconditions class.
Uses [Unity Toolbox](https://github.com/arimger/Unity-Editor-Toolbox) to draw a scene selector on unity's top bar.

### State Machines
`https://github.com/LucasOCastro/Shared-Unity-Utilities.git/?path=Packages/SharedStateMachines/`
My personal state machine implementation, meant to be usable in many contexts and with a WIP custom editor.
