# Shared Unity Utilities
This is a personal collection of packages I use in my own projects. Many things are heavily inspired by [git-amend](https://www.youtube.com/@git-amend)'s videos on youtube.

### Project Setup
`https://github.com/LucasOCastro/Shared-Unity-Utilities.git/?path=Packages/Automated Setup/`
Automatically creates my usual folder structure and imports my packages and assets of choice, including Shared Utilities below.

### Shared Utilities
`https://github.com/LucasOCastro/Shared-Unity-Utilities.git/?path=Packages/SharedUtilities/`
Extension methods I use often, a preconditions class, ScriptableObject based settings, toolbar drawing, and generally utilities usable in every project.

### State Machines
`https://github.com/LucasOCastro/Shared-Unity-Utilities.git/?path=Packages/SharedStateMachines/`
My personal state machine implementation, meant to be usable in many contexts and with a WIP custom editor.
